<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Ere from under earth again like fire the violet kindle,</span> <span class="linenum">[<i>Str. 1.</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1">Ere the holy buds and hoar on olive-branches bloom,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ere the crescent of the last pale month of winter dwindle,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Shrink, and fall as falls a dead leaf on the dead month's tomb,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Round the hills whose heights the first-born olive-blossom brightened,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Round the city brow-bound once with violets like a bride,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Up from under earth again a light that long since lightened<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Breaks, whence all the world took comfort as all time takes pride.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Pride have all men in their fathers that were free before them,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">In the warriors that begat us free-born pride have we:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But the fathers of their spirits, how may men adore them,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">With what rapture may we praise, who bade our souls be free?<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span><span class="i0">Sons of Athens born in spirit and truth are all born free men;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Most of all, we, nurtured where the north wind holds his reign:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Children all we sea-folk of the Salaminian seamen,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Sons of them that beat back Persia they that beat back Spain.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Since the songs of Greece fell silent, none like ours have risen;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Since the sails of Greece fell slack, no ships have sailed like ours;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How should we lament not, if her spirit sit in prison?<br /></span>
<span class="i1">How should we rejoice not, if her wreaths renew their flowers?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All the world is sweeter, if the Athenian violet quicken:<br /></span>
<span class="i1">All the world is brighter, if the Athenian sun return:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All things foul on earth wax fainter, by that sun's light stricken:<br /></span>
<span class="i1">All ill growths are withered, where those fragrant flower-lights burn.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All the wandering waves of seas with all their warring waters<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Roll the record on for ever of the sea-fight there,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When the capes were battle's lists, and all the straits were slaughter's,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And the myriad Medes as foam-flakes on the scattering air.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ours the lightning was that cleared the north and lit the nations,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">But the light that gave the whole world light of old was she:<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span><span class="i0">Ours an age or twain, but hers are endless generations:<br /></span>

<span class="i1">Men that wear the sign of Greeks upon you sealed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yours is yet the choice to write yourselves in story<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Sons of them that fought the Marathonian field.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Slaves of no man were ye, said your warrior poet,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Neither subject unto man as underlings:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yours is now the season here wherein to show it,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">If the seed ye be of them that knew not kings.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If ye be not, swords nor words alike found brittle<br /></span>
<span class="i1">From the dust of death to raise you shall prevail:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Subject swords and dead men's words may stead you little,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">If their old king-hating heart within you fail.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If your spirit of old, and not your bonds, be broken,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">If the kingless heart be molten in your breasts,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By what signs and wonders, by what word or token,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Shall ye drive the vultures from your eagles' nests?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All the gains of tyrants Freedom counts for losses;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Nought of all the work done holds she worth the work,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When the slaves whose faith is set on crowns and crosses<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Drive the Cossack bear against the tiger Turk.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Neither cross nor crown nor crescent shall ye bow to,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Nought of Araby nor Jewry, priest nor king:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As your watchword was of old, so be it now too:<br /></span>
<span class="i1">As from lips long stilled, from yours let healing spring.<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span><span class="i0">Through the fights of old, your battle-cry was healing,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And the Saviour that ye called on was the Sun:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dawn by dawn behold in heaven your God, revealing<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Light from darkness as when Marathon was won.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Gods were yours yet strange to Turk or Galilean,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Light and Wisdom only then as gods adored:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Pallas was your shield, your comforter was P&aelig;an,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">When the whole world's eye was Athens, these were yours, and theirs were ye.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Light was given you of your wisdom, light ye gave the world again:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As the sun whose godhead lightened on her soul was Hellas then:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yea, the least of all her children as the chosen of other men.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Change your hearts not with your garments, nor your faith with creeds that change:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Truth was yours, the truth which time and chance transform not nor estrange:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Purer truth nor higher abides not in the reach of time's whole range.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Gods are they in all men's memories and for all time's periods,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They that hurled the host back seaward which had scourged the sea with rods:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Gods for us are all your fathers, even the least of these as gods.<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span><span class="i0">In the dark of days the thought of them is with us, strong to save,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They that had no lord, and made the Great King lesser than a slave;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They that rolled all Asia back on Asia, broken like a wave.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No man's men were they, no master's and no God's but these their own:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Gods not loved in vain nor served amiss, nor all yet overthrown:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Love of country, Freedom, Wisdom, Light, and none save these alone.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">King by king came up against them, sire and son, and turned to flee:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Host on host roared westward, mightier each than each, if more might be:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Field to field made answer, clamorous like as wave to wave at sea.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Strife to strife responded, loud as rocks to clangorous rocks respond<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where the deep rings wreck to seamen held in tempest's thrall and bond,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till when war's bright work was perfect peace as radiant rose beyond:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Peace made bright with fruit of battle, stronger made for storm gone down,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With the flower of song held heavenward for the violet of her crown<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Woven about the fragrant forehead of the fostress maiden's town.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Gods arose alive on earth from under stroke of human hands:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As the hands that wrought them, these are dead, and mixed with time's dead sands:<br /></span>

<h2>SUNRISE</h2>


<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">If the wind and the sunlight of April and August had mingled the past and hereafter<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In a single adorable season whose life were a rapture of love and of laughter,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the blithest of singers were back with a song; if again from his tomb as from prison,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If again from the night or the twilight of ages Aristophanes had arisen,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With the gold-feathered wings of a bird that were also a god upon earth at his shoulders,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the gold-flowing laugh of the manhood of old at his lips, for a joy to beholders,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He alone unrebuked of presumption were able to set to some adequate measure<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The delight of our eyes in the dawn that restores them the sun of their sense and the pleasure.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For the days of the darkness of spirit are over for all of us here, and the season<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When desire was a longing, and absence a thorn, and rejoicing a word without reason.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For the roof overhead of the pines is astir with delight as of jubilant voices,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the floor underfoot of the bracken and heather alive as a heart that rejoices.<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[Pg 369]</a></span><span class="i0">For the house that was childless awhile, and the light of it darkened, the pulse of it dwindled,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rings radiant again with a child's bright feet, with the light of his face is rekindled.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the ways of the meadows that knew him, the sweep of the down that the sky's belt closes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Grow gladder at heart than the soft wind made them whose feet were but fragrant with roses,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Though the fall of the year be upon us, who trusted in June and by June were defrauded,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the summer that brought us not back the desire of our eyes be gone hence unapplauded.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For July came joyless among us, and August went out from us arid and sterile,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the hope of our hearts, as it seemed, was no more than a flower that the seasons imperil,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the joy of our hearts, as it seemed, than a thought which regret had not heart to remember,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till four dark months overpast were atoned for, and summer began in September.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hark, April again as a bird in the house with a child's voice hither and thither:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">See, May in the garden again with a child's face cheering the woods ere they wither.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">June laughs in the light of his eyes, and July on the sunbright cheeks of him slumbers,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And August glows in a smile more sweet than the cadence of gold-mouthed numbers.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In the morning the sight of him brightens the sun, and the noon with delight in him flushes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the silence of nightfall is music about him as soft as the sleep that it hushes.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We awake with a sense of a sunrise that is not a gift of the sundawn's giving,<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[Pg 370]</a></span><span class="i0">And a voice that salutes us is sweeter than all sounds else in the world of the living,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And a presence that warms us is brighter than all in the world of our visions beholden,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Though the dreams of our sleep were as those that the light of a world without grief makes golden.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For the best that the best of us ever devised as a likeness of heaven and its glory,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What was it of old, or what is it and will be for ever, in song or in story,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or in shape or in colour of carven or painted resemblance, adored of all ages,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But a vision recorded of children alive in the pictures of old or the pages?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where children are not, heaven is not, and heaven if they come not again shall be never:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But the face and the voice of a child are assurance of heaven and its promise for ever.<br /></span>

property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
